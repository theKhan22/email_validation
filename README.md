# email_validation
This is a python script designed to do basic email validation.
The following tasks are performed by the script:
  - User is prompted to enter an email.
  - The program validates the email format.
  - If the email is valid:
    - Check if it already exists in the storage.
      - If yes, suggest an alternative email.
      - If no, store the email in the chosen storage medium.
    - If the email is not valid, print an error message and prompt the user to enter the email again.
